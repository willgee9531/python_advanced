# ADVANCED PYTHON CONCEPTS

This repository contains advanced Python concepts and projects that demonstrate the power and flexibility of Python programming. The projects are designed to help me deepen my understanding of Python and explore its advanced features.

## Projects

1. [**Arbitrary Arguments**](./arbitrary_args/): accepting a variable number of arguments.
2. [**Decorators**](./decorators/): modifying the behavior of a function or class.
3. [**Generators**](./generators/): creating iterators using a function that yields values.
4. [**Context Managers**](./context_managers/): managing resources with a context manager.
5. [**Metaclasses**](./metaclasses/): customizing class creation with metaclasses.
6. [**Type Hints**](./type_hints/): adding type hints to improve code readability and maintainability.
7. [**Asyncio**](./asyncio/): writing asynchronous code using the asyncio library.
8. [**Type Checking**](./type_checking/): using type checking tools to ensure code correctness.
9. [**Data Classes**](./data_classes/): simplifying class definitions with data classes.
10. [**Pattern Matching**](./pattern_matching/): using structural pattern matching introduced in Python 3.10.
11. [**Function Annotations**](./function_annotations/): adding metadata to function parameters and return values.
12. [**Descriptors**](./descriptors/): creating reusable properties with descriptors.
13. [**Abstract Base Classes**](./abstract_base_classes/): defining abstract methods and properties in classes.
14. [**Type Aliases**](./type_aliases/): creating type aliases for better code readability.
15. [**Function Overloading**](./function_overloading/): defining multiple functions with the same name but different signatures.
16. [**Weak References**](./weak_references/): managing memory with weak references.
17. [**Custom Iterators**](./custom_iterators/): implementing custom iterator classes.
18. [**Coroutines**](./coroutines/): using coroutines for cooperative multitasking.
19. [**Threading**](./threading/): working with threads to perform concurrent operations.
20. [**Multiprocessing**](./multiprocessing/): using multiple processes to perform parallel computations.
